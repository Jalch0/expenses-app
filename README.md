## About The Project

</div>

This application made in PHP and some styles and animations in CSS is the product of a university project where the company La Media Naranja located in Venezuela was used as an image.

Some of the app's features:

* Functional login and registration page with hash encryption
* Record of expenses and history with dates and days
* Administrator page: Category registration, overviews.

Of course, no one template will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue. Thanks to all the people have contributed to expanding this template!
